# Agents

## Basic info

This project uses a basic React development workflow.
Below are some baseline agent-like tips, conventions, and roles for React developers contributing to this codebase.

## Responsibilities

- Write clean, simple React components using function components and hooks.
- Maintain a clear component structure and avoid deeply nested JSX.
- Use prop-types or TypeScript for type safety.
- Separate logic, style, and markup for better maintainability.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Keep code DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself).
- Try to avoid `useEffect` as much as possible
- Comment when it is absolutely necessary, otherwise, don't

## Guidelines

- Use function components and React hooks.
- Use `.tsx` extensions for React components.
- Keep each component in its own file when practical.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- Ensure UI and logic is accessible and responsive.
- Use ES6+ syntax (const/let, arrow functions, destructuring, etc).
- Always lint and format your code (Prettier, ESLint).
- Always proprize wrapping functions and variables in components with `useCallback` or `useMemo`
- Dont use "React." directly import the component needed

### SCSS

- Don't use comments
- Follow BEM standards
- Use helper classes and css variables we made in helpers.scss, colors.scss, spacing.scss
- use HEX for colors

## Example Agent Task

- Build a Button component that accepts children, `onClick`, and `variant` props, with simple styling. Provide an example usage in a story or demo component.

## Onboarding

- Install dependencies using `npm install`.
- Use `npm run dev`, or equivalent to run the development environment.
- Review existing components in the `/components` directory.
- Ask in the team channel if unsure about patterns or need a review.
